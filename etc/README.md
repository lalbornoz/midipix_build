## 1. What is Midipix, and how is it different?

midipix is a development environment that lets you create programs
for Windows using the standard C and POSIX APIs. No compromises made,
no shortcuts taken.  
  
If you are interested in cross-platform programming that reclaims
the notion of write once, compile everywhere; if you believe that the
'standard' in the C Standard Library should not be a null signifier;
and if you like cooking your code without #ifdef hell and low-level
minutiae, then this page is for you.  
  
midipix makes cross-platform programming better, simpler and faster,
specifically by bringing a modern, conforming C Runtime Library to the
Windows platform. While the idea itself is not new, the approach taken
in midipix to code portability is radically different from that found
in other projects.

### 2.1. Building, installing and using a Midipix distribution

A Midipix distribution consists of the following:

* the native Midipix toolchain, consisting of perk, gcc, its dependencies,
  and binutils,
* musl, a lightweight, fast, simple, and free libc&lbrack;[1](https://www.musl-libc.org/faq.html)&rbrack; used by Midipix,
* the Midipix runtime components that bridge the gap between the libc and the
  executive subsystems of all Windows NT-derived Windows OS starting with and
  including Windows XP, and
* a steadily increasing number of 3rd party open source packages, as expected in
  any modern POSIX-compliant \*nix environment, including GNU coreutils, shells,
  libraries such as ncurses, libressl, as well as Perl and Python.

Install the build-time dependencies listed in section [2.1.1](#211-build-time-dependencies),
clone this repository (e.g. ``git clone https://dev.midipix.org/build/midipix_build``)
and run the following command line:

```shell
./build.sh -a nt64 -b release -D zipdist -P -v
```

By default, the build will take place within ``${HOME}/midipix/nt64/release``
and package archive files and/or Git repositores will be downloaded into
``${HOME}/midipix/dlcache``. Consult sections [4.2](#42-build-variables) and
[4.4](#44-package-variables) for the list of available build/package variables
and how to override them.  
Parallelisation is enabled by the above command line for both packages that can
be built independently of each other and ``make(1)`` via ``-j``, limited to the
amount of logical processors on the build host divided by two (2).

On successful completion of the build, a ZIP archive containing the Midipix
distribution will be created inside ``${PREFIX}`` (see section [4.2](#42-build-variables).)
Create a directory on the target machine and extract the contents of the distribution
ZIP archive into it, run ``bash.bat``, and then ``/install.sh`` inside the resulting
self-contained Midipix installation shell window.  
  
Make sure to consult the notate bene below:  
  
> N.B. The pathname of the target directory containing ``bash.bat`` and all other
distribution files must not contain whitespaces.  
  
> N.B. The Midipix installer defaults to ``/dev/fs/c/midipix (C:\midipix)``. If left
unchanged, the distribution ZIP archive must not be extracted into a directory of the
same pathname.  
  
> N.B. The user installing and using Midipix must have been delegated the ``SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege``

### 2.4. Troubleshooting

Midipix presently provides, inter alia, strace-like functionality via
ntctty's logging capabilities. This is available both through the regular
``strace(1)`` command as distributed, which however **must** be provided
with an absolute pathname without consideration for ``${PATH}``, as well
as directly via ``ntctty.exe`` for a session by running ``ntctty.exe``
with the ``--log-level 7`` option, e.g.:

```shell
$ #strace ls -la /        # (incorrect, relative pathname)
$ strace /bin/ls -la /    # (correct, absolute pathname)
$ ntctty.exe --log-level 7 -e /bin/ls -la /
$ ntctty.exe --log-level=7 -e /bin/ls -la /
$ ntctty.exe --log-level 7 -e /bin/sh -c "ls -la /"
$ ntctty.exe --log-level=7 -e /bin/sh -c "ls -la /"
```

By default, ``ntctty.exe`` log files are written into the /var/log/ntctty
directory; this may be adjusted with the ``--log-dir`` and/or
``--log-file`` options. ``strace(1)`` logs to stderr by default.

## 3.2. Adding a package

Packages are grouped into *build groups* according to sets of common package
variable defaults, such as ``${PKG_CFLAGS_CONFIGURE}, ${PKG_LDFLAGS_CONFIGURE}``
and ``${PKG_CONFIGURE_ARGS}``, and semantic interrelatedness, such as the
``native_runtime`` build group comprising the Midipix runtime components.
Packages may belong to more than one build group such as when subsumed by a shorthand
build group e.g. the ``dev_packages`` build group, as long as the default set of build
groups or as overriden on the command line does not entail group membership conflicts.  
  
Build groups files beneath ``groups.d/`` named ``[0-9][0-9][0-9].<group name>.group``
contain package variable defaults, optionally the alphabetically sorted list of contained
packages, if any, in ``<upper case group name>_PACKAGES``, and their package variables
sorted alphabetically with the exception of ``${PKG_DEPENDS}`` (if present,)
``${PKG_SHA256SUM}``, ``${PKG_URL}``, and ``${PKG_VERSION}``, and/or ``${PKG_URLS_GIT}``,
which are specified in this order. Build group files require the following epilogue, the
parameters enclosed in square brackets being optional:

```shell
ex_pkg_register_group "<group name>" "${RTL_FILEOP_SOURCE_FNAME}" [["owner|copy"] ["auto|noauto"]];

# vim:filetype=sh textwidth=0
```

If ``copy`` is specified, the build group will copy all of its packages from their respective
build groups without taking ownership thereof, if ``owner`` is specified, the default, the build
group owns all of its packages. If ``noauto`` is specified, the build group will not be added to
the list of build groups to build by default, if ``auto`` is specified, the build group will be
added to the list of build groups to build by default.  
  
If a build group that specifies ``copy`` should copy all of its build group variables from another
build group, use the following code:

```shell
ex_pkg_copy_group_vars "<source group name>" "<destination group name>";
```

Additionally, single package files may be added beneath ``groups.d/[0-9][0-9][0-9].<group name>.d/``,
named ``<package name>.package`` containing the package's variables, with the following epilogue,
the parameters enclosed in square brackets being optional:

```shell
ex_pkg_register "<package_name>" "${RTL_FILEOP_SOURCE_FNAME}" ["<group name>"];

# vim:filetype=sh textwidth=0
```

1. Pick a build group according to the criteria mentioned and specifiy the set of package
variables required (see above and section [4.4](#44-package-variables)) in either the
corresponding group file or a single package file; in the former case, do also add the
package to the build group's list of contained packages.
  
2. Consult section [3.5](#35-patches-and-vars-files) if the package to be added
requires patches or additional code amending or replacing package build steps
or the entire package build. Consult section [4.1](#41-build-steps) for a list
of package build steps and how they are overriden.

## 3.3. Addressing build failure

During package build, standard error and output are redirected into a log file beneath
``${BUILD_WORKDIR}`` named ``${PKG_NAME}_stderrout.log``, following a package variable
dump. If ``-V build`` was specified, package logs will additionally be printed to standard

rudimentary debugging purposes. Additionally, packages using GNU autotools will, if
package configuration failed or appears relevant, log the configuration process in detail

### 3.4. Package archive files and Git repositories

Packages may have either or both of a SHA-256 message digest checked and to be extracted tarball
(set in ``${PKG_URL}``, ``${PKG_FNAME}``, and ``${PKG_SHA256SUM}``) and/or Git repository or set
thereof (set in ``${PKG_URLS_GIT}``.) Complementing these, an implicitly inferred or, in the
presence of both, explicit primary source directory is specified for each package in ``${PKG_SUBDIR}``.
Furthermore, these may be subject to download caching and/or setting up as well as maintaining
mirrors, including automatic cleanup as well as deduplication in both cases.  
  
A list of pertinent package variables and their formats follows:  

| Name           | Format                                          |

## 3.5. Patches and ``vars`` files

Package patches are applied prior and/or subsequent to (GNU autotools or similar) package
configuration during the ``configure_patch_pre`` and/or ``configure_patch`` build steps,
respectively (see section [4.1](#41-build-steps).) Patch files are searched for beneath
``patches/`` with the following globs and in-order:
* ``${PKG_NAME}-${PKG_VERSION}_pre.local.patch``
  or ``${PKG_NAME}_pre.local.patch`` (for packages lacking ``${PKG_VERSION}``)
* ``${PKG_NAME}-${PKG_VERSION}_pre.local@${BUILD_HNAME}.patch``
  or ``${PKG_NAME}_pre.local@${BUILD_HNAME}.patch`` (for packages lacking ``${PKG_VERSION}``)
* ``${PKG_NAME}/*.patch``
* ``${PKG_NAME}-${PKG_VERSION}.local.patch``
  or ``${PKG_NAME}.local.patch`` (for packages lacking ``${PKG_VERSION}``)
* ``${PKG_NAME}-${PKG_VERSION}.local@${BUILD_HNAME}.patch``
  or ``${PKG_NAME}.local@${BUILD_HNAME}.patch`` (for packages lacking ``${PKG_VERSION}``)
* ``${PKG_PATCHES_EXTRA}`` (if set)
  
If the default set of package build steps does not suffice, such as if additional commands
must be executed after package configuration or prior to building, or if an entire or all
build step must be replaced, overrides may be specified in the form of functions in the
package's ``vars/${PKG_NAME}.vars`` as well as ``vars.<group name>/${PKG_NAME}.vars``
``vars`` file(s). Consult section [4.1](#41-build-steps) for a list of package build steps
and how they are overriden.

## 4.1. Build steps

Package builds are divided up into consecutively executed build steps until
completion or aborted on failure unless relaxed mode is enabled by passing
``-R``.  
  
Each build step corresponds to a function in the corresponding ``subr/pkg_*.subr``
script and may be overriden entirely by a function named ``pkg_<package name>_<build step>()``
or composed in terms of prior and/or subsequent execution by a function named
``pkg_<package name>_<build step>_pre()`` and/or ``pkg_<package name>_<build step>_post()``,
respectively, in the package's ``vars`` file. If a function named ``pkg_<package name>_all()``
exists, it will override all build steps.  
  
Build step functions receive the following arguments in the order specified:
  
| Name          | Description                                              |

| \_pkg\_name   | Group name                                               |
| \_restart\_at | Optional list of build steps to restart package build at |
  
Build step status is tracked on a per-package basis by state files beneath
``${BUILD_WORKDIR}`` following the format ``.<package name>.<build step>``;
package build completion corresponds to the pseudo-build step ``finish``.

File and directory installation, comprising e.g. copying, moving, creating
symbolic links, setting owner and/or permission metadata, are expressed in
a descriptive domain-specific language and integrated with package building
via the package variable ``${PKG_INSTALL_FILES_V2}``, applying during
``install_files`` after the ``install_make`` build step, and ``${PKG_INSTALL_FILES_DESTDIR}``
and ``${PKG_INSTALL_FILES_DESTDIR_EXTRA}`` during ``install_subdirs``. The
``${PKG_INSTALL_FILES_V2}`` must adhere to the following syntax specified in EBNF:

Single ``"="`` characters in ``spec``, the ``"%<"`` and ``"%["`` character
sequences in ``pattern_spec`` and ``expr_spec``, resp., and the ``sexpr_op_unary``
as well as ``sexpr_op_binary`` characters or character sequences may be
escaped with a single backslash (``"\"``.) ``SH_SUBSTRING_PATTERN`` differs
from ``SH_GLOB_PATTERN`` solely in that any of ``sexpr_op_unary`` and
``sexpr_op_binary`` occuring at the beginning of or in the former must
be escaped with a single backslash (``"\"``,) e.g. ``"#\#pattern"`` and
``"%\%pattern"``, etc. and ``"#pat\%ern"`` and ``%patt\#ern", etc., resp.  
  
Named parameters (``PARAMETER``) are supplied via the ``-p name=value``
argument to ``rtl_install()``, whereas numbered parameters are for
internal usage only; the ``"DNAME"``, ``"FNAME"``, and ``"ITEM"`` parameters
lazily evaluate to the directory name, file (aka base) name, and full
pathname of the current item being processed relative to a specification
with a pattern in it.
  
The following parameters are defined by default during ``install_files``:

### 4.4. Package variables

The following variables are package-specific and receive their value from either
top-level defaults defined in ``vars.env.d/*.env``, build group-specific defaults from the
build group the package pertains to and defined in its corresponding file beneath
``groups.d/`` or ``groups.d/[0-9][0-9][0-9].<group name>.d/``, or package-specific overrides
defined either in the latter and/or in its corresponding file beneath ``vars/``, with one of
the following prefixes:

| Variable name prefix                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- |
| DEFAULT                                           |
| DEFAULT_``${BUILD_TYPE}``                         |
| DEFAULT_``${GROUP_NAME}``                         |
| ``${GROUP_NAME}``                                 |
| [PKG_``${RELATED_PACKAGE(S)}``]                   |
| [PKG_``${RELATED_PACKAGE(S)}``_``${BUILD_KIND}``] |
| PKG_``${NAME}``                                   |
| PKG_``${NAME}``_``${BUILD_KIND}``                 |

Additionally, overrides may be specified on a per-build basis on the command-
line, with each variable prefixed w/ ``PKG_``, e.g.:
``./build.sh [ ... ] PKG_ZSH_CC="/usr/bin/clang"``.  
  
The minimum set of package variables that must be provided is ``SHA256SUM, URL,
VERSION`` and/or ``URLS_GIT``, respectively.

> N.B. Input sanitisation is mandatory whenever input may form part of a parameter name, most usually
when indexing with input as a key into a (pseudo-)hash, e.g. PKG_ZSH_<...input...>; failing to do so
may introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g.: $(arbitrary_command) and ${arbitrary_variable} facilitating
code execution and information disclosure, resp.)

*(reproduced from &lbrack;[shrtl](https://github.com/lalbornoz/shrtl/blob/master/README.md)&rbrack;)*

If no rationale is specified for any specific point, the rationale is avoidance of undefined behaviour
and/or implicit behaviour contingent on often subtle special cases, both of which are prone to cause
hard to debug or even diagnose bugs.

### Shell options

1)  The `noglob` option is set at all times *except* for when globbing is required, e.g.:
    `set +o noglob; files=*; set -o noglob`
2)  The `nounset` option is set at all times; if a parameter is to be expanded that may be
    unset, use the `${parameter:-word}` expansion format.
3)  The `errexit` option is unset at all times *except* for top-level subshell code that does
    *not* engage in conditional evaluation, e.g. `([...] set -o errexit; [...]) &` due to its
    implicit unsetting when a/any function is subject to conditional evaluation, e.g.: `[...]
    set -o errexit; [...] if some_function; then [ ... ] fi`

### Quoting and brace-enclosing

4)  Quoting with single quotes or double quotes is mandatory at all times *except* for when field 
    splitting subsequent to parameter expansion, etc. is required, e.g.: `params="a b c";
    param="single parameter"; fn ${params} "${param}"`
5)  Enclosing parameter names in braces is mandatory at all times, e.g.: `${parameter_name123}`

### Checking parameter status

6)  Checking for whether a parameter is set/non-empty or unset/empty is expressed with the following
    the idiom: `[ "${parameter:+1}" = 1 ]` and `[ "${parameter:+1}" != 1 ]` 
  
    This is necessary to avoid the potentially costly expansion of a parameter's value when only its
    status of being set/non-empty or unset/empty is of concern, particularly when this is done repeatedly.

### Functions

7)  Functions must explicitly return either `0` or `1` at all times *except* for when specific
    return exit statuses are specified according to the function's interface contract.
8)  Function names must have namespace prefixes followed by a `p` in the topmost namespace prefix
    field in private functions, e.g.: `rtlp_log_do_something() { [...] }`
9)  The non-POSIX but extremely widely available `local` command must be used at at all times
    in functions on all function-local variables.  
  
    This is necessary in order to avoid polluting the (global) parameter namespace.
10) Function-local variables must be lower case and prefixed with a `_`, a prefix comprised of the
    initial letters of each word in the function's name plus, in private functions, the `p` topmost
    namespace prefix field postfix, and a `_`, where words are separated by `_` characters, e.g.:
    `rtlp_log_do_something() { local _rplds_parameter=""; [...] }` and `ex_something() {
    local _es_parameter=""; [ ...] }` 
  
    This is necessary in order to prevent implicit conflicts between two or more functions that share
    a call path and would otherwise use the same variables names, such as `function1() { local
    list="${1}"; function2 "${list}"; }; function2() { local list="${2}"; }`, particularly when those
    functions acess and/or mutate each other's variables. Additionally, local variables are thus marked
    with a `_` prefix and by being lower case.

### `eval` rules

11) The following special characters must be escaped with a backslash at all times in `eval`
    expressions: `<newline>`, `"`, `'`, `[`, `\`, `]`, `<backtick>`, `$`
12) If parameter expansion is to be evaluated with respect to a parameter reference, the following idiom
    must be used at all times: `eval [...]\${${rparameter[...]}}`
13) If quoting with single quotes or double quotes is required - see 4) - or brace-enclosing - see 5) -
    and with respect to 11), viz. the single quotes or double quotes have been escaped with a backslash,
    something must be evaluated as a single field, then that field must be doubly quoted with single or
    double quotes, where the second set of quotes must not be escaped with a backslash, e.g.: `
    rparameter=parameter; eval ${rparameter}="\"a b c\""`. 
    This is very rarely required.

### Passing arguments

14) The `fork/exec/write`-`read` pattern where a parameter is set to the result of a command
    substitution expression which is executed in a subshell process, e.g.: `parameter="$(function)"`
    is prohibited at all times *except* when an actual external command is invoked, e.g. `sort(1)`
    or `sed(1)`.  
  
    This is necessary due to the very significant cost of the mentioned pattern, particularly concerning
    primitive e.g. list or string processing functions with high contention.
15) If a function is to return, produce, evaluate to, etc. an arbitrary value apart from the exit status,
    it shall do so by receiving references to the target variables in the callers' scope from the caller
    prefixed with a single `$` character, e.g. `function \$parameter` and `function() {
    local _fn_rparameter="${1#\$}"; [..]; }` which are then set with `eval` expressions: `
    function() { local _fn_rparameter="${1#\$}"; [...]; eval ${_fn_rparameter}=\'a b c\'; };` Refer to
    11)-13) for the rules concerning `eval`.  

    This is necessary due to 14) as well as the absence of any other calling convention other than using
    implicit global variables, e.g.: `function1() { VARIABLE=; function2; }; function2() { VARIABLE=1;
    }`
